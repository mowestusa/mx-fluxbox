Default components L-R: pager, iconbar, systray, clock (change order ~/.fluxbox/init)
Right-click empty iconbar section (no app open) for options, including visibility, length, placement and clock. 
To adjust the clock, including whether 12h or 24h, click Edit clock format.

Xfce panel
Components: Applications menu
To change Panel features: right-click panel > Panel > Properties. 

Menu
The menu is set by ~/.fluxbox/mx-menu.
A few alternative menus are available in ~/.fluxbox/menus_other/
For other menus, do a web search on "fluxbox menu example"
To edit a menu, 

Windows
Resize windows: Alt + right click near the corner you want to change
Right-click title bar: menu of options, including remember...

Tabs
With at least two windows visible on your desktop use Ctrl click on the upper window tab of one window and drag it into the other open window. The two windows will now be grouped together with window tabs in the upper window tab bar. You may now perform a window operation that will affect the entire window "group". To reverse the tabbing use Ctrl+left click on a tab and drag it to an empty space on the desktop. (< Arch Wiki)

Workspaces
Middle-click on open desktop enables change, rename, add/delete
Number set to 3 by default, can go up to 12

Styles
Styles are simple text files that tell fluxbox how to generate the appearance of different components of the window manager. Fluxbox ships with a large number, and many more can be found online with a web search on "fluxbox styles." They include a background image, but that is blocked in MXfb by a line in ~/.fluxbox/overlay. To allow the style to determine the background, place a hash mark in front to the line so that it looks like this:
----------
! The following line will prevent styles from setting the background.
#background: none
----------

Backgrounds
Backgrounds will be determined by the style selected unless blocked (default) by the overlay file.
The list that pops up from the menu entry includes user backgrounds (~/.fluxbox/backgrounds) and system backgrounds (/usr/share/backgrounds), separated by a horizontal line. This setup allows you to put your preferred backgrounds in the user folder and be able to select among the group with a simple click.

Keystrokes 
Many listed by default in ~/.fluxbox/keys, though not all of them work by default.
Mod1 = Alt
Mod4 = Logo key (Windows, Apple)
Control = Control
Shift = Shift

Apps
When an app is open, you can right-click the title bar and set any of the options available. For instance, you can select to remember workspace, size, etc. Your choices are recorded in ~/.fluxbox/apps.
--Communicate > Video: for that to work Skype needs to be installed

Misc
To adjust brightness, right-click the battery icon in the systray
